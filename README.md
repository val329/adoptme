# adoptme
Plug this app into your blog and help find our furry friends a new home, one cat at a time. 

This app is a front-end demonstration of modern animal shelter adoption page. It transforms data from the public API thecatapi.com into an interactive "meet me" experience. The data used in this project is for demonstration purposes only. 

####What can I do with it?
Check out pets available for adoption, one by one. View their picture, breed, name (click to check if they have it!), and see if you could vibe based on their description. If you found a furry friend that steals your heart, add them to favorites by clicking ♥️ button, or click Next to check out one of their siblings.
