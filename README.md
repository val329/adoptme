# adoptme
Plug this app into your blog and help find our furry friends a new home, one cat at a time.  

This app is a demonstration of modern animal shelter adoption page. It transforms data from the public API thecatapi.com into an interactive "meet me" experience. The data used in this project is for demonstration purposes only. This project uses [VITE] (https://vite.dev/guide/) framework for scaffolding and development. 

**What can I do with it?**  
Check out pets available for adoption, one by one. View their picture, breed, name (click to check if they have it!), and see if you could vibe based on their description. If you found a furry friend that steals your heart, add them to favorites by clicking ♥️ button, or click Next to check out one of their siblings. 
  
**How do I install it?**  
1. Get your API key from the [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/), free for developers. 
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Set up an environment variable: in the root folder, create .env file and paste your key in the following format: VITE_CAT_API_KEY=yourkeyhere
4. To install dependencies for [VITE](https://vite.dev/guide/), run 'npm install' in the project folder from the terminal (check out the link for more installation guides). This should generate **node_modules** folder in your cloned project.
